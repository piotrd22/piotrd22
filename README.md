### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

#### ðŸš€ About me
I'm Piotr, a Polish dev with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I focus on backend development, mainly within the Java ecosystem, and have a keen interest in distributed systems and modular monoliths.

In my free time, I enjoy staying active through sports, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and relaxing with a good movie.
